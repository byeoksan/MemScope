Suggestions

    Let's make this code OOP based one.

Big picture

    I want at least four classes which can do equivalent things.

    1. Class ADBHandler

        Simple Description

            This class would handle all connection related to ADB.

        Expected methods

            checkConnection()

            closeConnection()

            retrieveDmesg()

            retrieveLogcat()


    2. Class VirshHandler
       
        Simple Description

            This class would handle all actions related to virsh

        Expected methods

            createGuest()

            resumeGuest()

            suspendGuest()

            destroyGuest()

            createDump()

            testAppArmor() !!! optional for Ubuntu

    3. Class QMPHandler

        Simple Description
            
            This class would handle all qemu monitor actions if virsh does not exists
            This class would assume the guest is running with qemu

        Expected methods

            suspendGuest()

            resumeGuest()

            createDump()
            
            

    4. Class LibvirtHandler
        
        Simple Description

            This class would handle libvirt activity without virsh.
            The objective of this class is to make the program independent of subprocess
            module.

        Expected methods

            createGuest()
            
            resumeGuest()

            suspendGuest()

            destroyGuest()

            createDump()

    5. Class QEMUHandler

        
    With above 4 classes, here I mention two core features that is likely to be implemented

    1) Periodic dumpgen

        dump memory in periodic manners with logcat and dmesg logs.

    2) Event-based dumpgen

        dump memory when specific event happended in guest.
        This dump module should watch logcat and dmesg change and dump memory and event based on that.

    
    Additionally, these features can be added to make this tool fancier.
