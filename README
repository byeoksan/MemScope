MemScope
========

MemScope is a simple python script for identifying duplicated pages
on Android-x86 system based on physical memory snapshots.

MemScope has two functionalities.

Snapshot Acquisition
--------------------
MemScope requires physical memory snapshot or memory dump
in order to identify page duplication.
To get memory snapshots easily, it is good to use virtual
machine.
MemScope provides a way to interact with QEMU and take snapshots
periodically.

Duplication Identification
--------------------------
With the help of volatilitux, written by Emilien Girault, MemScope
explores memory spaces of all Android processes, including application
process and system process.
During the explore it constructs duplication table based on hash of
each page content.

Assumption
----------
MemScope assumes that each page used for virtual memory has size of 4KiB.

Environment
-----------
MemScope was tested with Android-x86 kitkat 4.4.4.

Note
----
MemScope has not been written to be used as python module.
